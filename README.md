### Hi there ðŸŒ±

"When you come to the fork in the road, pick it up!"

The above is my favourite quote because it challenges the individual to think differently. One of the reasons I am here.. learning and practicing a different way of problem solving. 

### Learning Journey 

* Python
* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript
* Vue
* TypeScript
* React
* Go
* gRPC

Collecting languages so I can say the quote, "a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one."

Since learning to code I get asked, "Backend or Frontend". My response is, if I don't know both (at least a little) than how do know I am building the right solution. 

### Practice, Practice, Practice 

Steep learning curve. 

I love the mentality of martial arts where one continues to practice a "Kata". It is the same with coding. Theory, drilling, revision and REPEAT. 
My journey is called, "My Black Belt Journey to Development". (Think Brazilian Jiu Jitsu where it can take someone at least 10 years to earn a black belt) and even once you get the belt, you never stop learning. 

### User Experience and Problem Solving Skills 

* Wireframing/ Lo-Fi/ Hi-Fi Design (use of Figma/ Miro/ Lucid Chart) 
* Analysis 
* Competitor Opportunities / Opportunity Canvas
* Story Mapping 
* Feature breakdown / Task / Ticket Creation (use of Jira/ Trello / Confluence) 
* Stakeholder engagement
* Intuitive design (Designing and building with a feeling of familiarity and comfort) 


I have found myself obsessed with the customer journey. Taking the skills I have learnt as a Product Manager to fine tune the experience of what I build.
